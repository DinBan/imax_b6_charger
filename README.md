# iMax B6 Charger stuff

This includes a couple of very basic examples of getting serial data from the imax B6 charger.
There is a lot of room for improvement, but I don't really use my B6 anymore.

**imax_b6_wifi.ino:**   
 * Designed for use with an ESP8266
 * Connects to your wifi
 * Runs a web server that will output status while you are charging
 
**imax_b6_charger.ino**
